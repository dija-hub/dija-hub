Hi, I’m Khadija 👋. I’m a student passionate about coding. I enjoy building simple but fun projects like games and websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m currently learning JavaScript while working on personal projects to improve my skills. My goal is to grow as a developer and share useful and creative work with the community. 🚀

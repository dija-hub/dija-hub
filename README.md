Hi,  I’m Khadija 
I’m a student passionate about coding 💻. I enjoy building simple but fun projects like games 🎮 and websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m currently learning JavaScript while working on personal projects to improve my skills ✨. My goal is to grow as a developer and share useful and creative work with the community. 🚀
